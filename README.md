# gymstats

## Environment

Personally I recommend on setting a virtual environment for running the project via
python3 -m venv <what ever path you like>

## Installing dependencies

python 3.10 is required (would technically speaking work with older one, 3.6 is minimum)
pip3 -r requirements.txt

## Running

The script can be run with either python3 src/gymstats.py or cd src && ./gymstats.py
or the like.
